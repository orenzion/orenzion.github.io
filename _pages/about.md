Hi :)

I am Oren, 30, from Tel-Aviv
I have many hobbies and interested in many subjects,
Accualy I think I am a very curious person and almost everything excites me.

That's why Idecided to do data science - this is my way to learn and study about different subjects.
through analyzing datasets related to my interest, data storytelling and revealing insights I dive into the data itself
and earn new knowledge about the different worlds I investigate.
